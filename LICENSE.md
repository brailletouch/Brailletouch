### 1. License Definition and Scope
The **Braille Touch Open and Community License (BTAC)** is a strong copyleft license ensuring that all code, hardware, concepts, methodologies, mechanisms, technological innovations, inventions, and any other creations or developments related to the Braille Touch project remain open, accessible, and cannot be privatized under any circumstances.

This license covers, but is not limited to:
- Source code and software.
- Hardware and physical components.
- Device designs.
- Innovative concepts and methodologies.
- Mechanisms and processes developed within the framework of the project.
- Any derivative invention or creation, whether technical, technological, or conceptual.

### 2. Permissions Granted by the License
Any person or entity has the right to:
- Use, copy, modify, distribute, and commercialize the code, hardware, concepts, innovations, and derivatives of the project, as long as the conditions described in this license are respected.

Modifications, improvements, or innovations must remain available to the community under this same license.

### 3. Modification and Contribution Registry
Whenever a modification, improvement, or new innovation is made, a detailed registry of all involved individuals and entities must be included. This registry must include:
- Name of the contributor or entity.
- Link to their repository, website, or where their work is published (if applicable).
- Clear and detailed description of the contribution (code, hardware, concept, methodology, etc.).

This registry must always reference the original Braille Touch project and design, as well as all previous contributions that have been integrated into the version being used.

The registry must be present and visible in:
- Project documentation.
- Source code.
- Design schemes or hardware files.
- Any document or presentation of innovative concepts or methodologies.

### 4. References and Mentions
All derivative work must include:
- A clear and visible reference to the original **Braille Touch** project.
- Links to the official website and original project repository.
- Detailed mentions of all previous contributions and modifications that have been incorporated into the derivative work, maintaining a chain of attributions reflecting the evolution of the project from its inception.

### 5. No Privatization
The code, hardware, methodologies, concepts, and any other aspect covered by this license cannot be privatized or used in closed projects. All derivative work must remain open under this same license, ensuring that any innovation related to the Braille Touch project is accessible to all and continues to be open-source and open-technology.

This principle extends to:
- Software and source code.
- Hardware and physical devices.
- Designs and inventions.
- Concepts and methodologies.
- Mechanisms and processes.

### 6. License Compatibility
Any derivative work, whether it uses part or all of the code, hardware, methodologies, or innovations covered by this license, must be distributed under the **BTAC License** without exception. This ensures that all related work remains accessible, open, and cannot be appropriated for private or closed projects.

This license also guarantees that any conceptual or technological innovation based on the original project must remain under this license, protecting all future contributions.

### 7. Commercialization
The code, hardware, concepts, methodologies, and derived products can be commercialized by any person or entity, provided that:
- The code and innovations remain open and publicly available under this license.
- The conditions of registry, contributor mention, and attribution to the original project are respected.

There are no restrictions on commercialization as long as access to knowledge and derived innovations remains free and community-driven.

### 8. Publication of Modifications and Innovations
All modifications, improvements, or technological or conceptual innovations must:
- Be published in a publicly accessible repository, preferably associated with the original project.
- Be notified to the original project, providing details about the nature of the modification or innovation.

This requirement ensures transparency in the development of the project and guarantees that the community can benefit from all improvements made.

### 9. Inclusion of Innovations and New Methodologies
Any innovation, whether in software, hardware, concepts, processes, or mechanisms, must be documented and appended to a list of improvements forming part of the original project. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Software and source code innovations.
- New methodologies or concepts applied to the project.
- Physical mechanisms or processes that improve hardware design or operation.
- Any invention or technology derived from the project.

### 10. Preservation of the License
This license cannot be modified or replaced by a more restrictive license or one that allows privatization. Any derivative work must continue under the **BTAC License**, preserving open access, collaboration, and the community spirit of the project.

This protection covers all code, hardware, concepts, methodologies, inventions, innovations, mechanisms, or processes developed as part of the project.

### 11. Attribution to the Original Project
All derivative or modified work must include a clear attribution to the original **Braille Touch** project and a link to the official repository or website. This must be present in:
- Project documentation.
- Source code.
- Hardware and physical devices.
- Any conceptual or methodological innovation derived from the project.

### 12. Patent Protection
By accepting this license, any person or entity agrees not to claim or enforce patents on any aspect of the code, hardware, concept, methodology, mechanism, or innovation derived from the Braille Touch project. This ensures that all innovations under this license remain open and not subject to legal restrictions.

### 13. Inclusion of Innovative Concepts and Methodologies
This license covers not only code and hardware but also innovative concepts, methodologies, and any invention associated with the project. Anyone contributing a new methodology, mechanism, or concept to the project must ensure that it is documented and publicly available, so it can be used and improved by others under this same license.

### 14. Continuity of the Community
The purpose of this license is to foster a collaborative community where all contributions, whether technical, conceptual, or methodological, are recognized and remain open for use, improvement, and distribution. By participating in this project, each contributor agrees to follow these principles and help preserve open access to knowledge.
